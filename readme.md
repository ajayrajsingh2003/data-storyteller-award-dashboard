# Data Storyteller Award – Tableau Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project showcases my Tableau dashboard that won the Data Storyteller Award in DS 630 – Data Visualization.
The dashboard was built using the heart disease Dataset to explore patterns, visualize key predictors, and communicate insights effectively.

### Key Highlights:
- Awarded **Data Storyteller** for excellence in data storytelling and dashboard design
- Built using Tableau’s **dashboards + story feature** for clarity and impact
- Insights were presented in a **storybook format (PDF included)**
- Recognition came at the same time as my selection as **President of the Data Science Club**, highlighting both technical and leadership skills
